# Advanced Programming: Final Exam Solution (Grade 92)

This repository contains the full solution for the comprehensive Final Exam of the Advanced Programming course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

This project showcases the culmination of all core skills: complex algorithmic problem-solving, advanced data preprocessing, and the implementation of Machine Learning models under strict, exam-simulated conditions.

## Key Achievement: Final Grade 92

The successful completion of this rigorous exam with a final grade of **92** validates high-level proficiency in all core Python and data science concepts taught in the program.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Holistic Problem Solving:** Integrating knowledge from all course modules (Algorithms, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, ML) into one cohesive, efficient solution.
* **Complex Data Preparation:** Implementing multi-step data cleaning, **Normalization** (Z-Score), **Label Encoding**, and feature engineering on the provided salary dataset.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Solving complex algorithmic challenges (e.g., matrix manipulation, optimized sorting) with efficient Python implementations.
* **Model Implementation:** Building and evaluating Classification models to predict a target variable (e.g., salary >50K).
